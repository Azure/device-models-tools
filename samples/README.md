# Resolution Samples for the Device Models Repository

DTDL models stored on a models repository following Azure IoT conventions can be located at a known location from the DTMI as described in [Resolution-Convention](https://github.com/Azure/iot-plugandplay-models-tools/wiki/Resolution-Convention).

The samples in `node` and `dotnet` show how to convert any given DTMI to a relative path which can then be used to fetch the model definition. The samples use the [global repository endpoint](https://devicemodels.azure.com) by default.
